    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What is a cookie?</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      A "cookie" is a tiny data file that we transfer onto your computer, mobile phone, or any other device that you use to access the Move Validators site, and is generally used for authentication and tracking. Every cookie expires after a certain period of time, but that period varies depending on what the cookie is used for and how your browser is configured.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8">
      Cookies are often categorized based on how long they remain active before they expire. A "session" cookie is one that generally expires when you close your web browser or mobile application. A "persistent" cookie is one that remains in your device, even after you close your browser or mobile application. A persistent cookie expires according to the duration set by us, or when you delete it manually.
    </p>

        <p>We will never use third-party cookies on our pages unless we get your permission to do so.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What are my cookie options?</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">While this is not a comprehensive list, below are some of the things that you can do to limit use of cookies and other locally-stored data technologies on your device. While cookies and other locally-stored data technologies may not be necessary to use our sites, some features may not function properly if you disable them.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">You can:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8">
      <li>Remove or disable specific locally-stored data on your browser's settings (you can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent)</li>
      <li>Use a browser that can block third-party cookies</li>
      <li>Install a plug-in to block locally-stored data, if one is available</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent tracking pixels from tracking your specific activity. A tracking pixel may still record an anonymous visit from your IP address, but unique information will not be recorded. If you do not want to receive tracking pixels, you will need to disable HTML images in your browser-based email client, and that may affect your ability to view images in other emails that you receive.
