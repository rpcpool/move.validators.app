      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2">Overall Validator Score</h3>
          <p>Our overall validator score is a composite metric that takes into account multiple performance factors including voting participation, block production, and infrastructure reliability.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2">Voting Record</h3>
          <p>The voting record score reflects a validator's participation in network governance and consensus. It measures the consistency and reliability of a validator's voting activity across epochs.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2">Last Epoch Performance</h3>
          <p>This metric shows the validator's performance in the most recent epoch, calculated as a percentage of rewards earned out of the maximum possible rewards. It provides an immediate indicator of current validator health.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2">Block Performance</h3>
          <p>Block performance measures a validator's success rate in block proposal and production. It takes into account factors such as proposal success rate and timing consistency.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2">Data Center Score</h3>
          <p>The data center score evaluates the quality and reliability of a validator's infrastructure, considering factors such as uptime, network connectivity, and geographic distribution.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

    <!-- Rewards Calculation -->
    <section class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-6 shadow">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Rewards Calculation</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Our rewards tracking system follows the official Aptos network specifications:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Rewards are earned through successful block proposals during each epoch</li>
        <li>The reward rate is uniform across all validators</li>
        <li>Maximum rewards are proportional to staking amount</li>
        <li>Rewards are distributed at the end of each epoch</li>
        <li>Performance is calculated as (earned rewards)/(maximum possible rewards)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">The rewards performance shown in our interface reflects the cumulative performance across all epochs, while the last epoch performance provides a snapshot of recent validator activity.</p>
